# MIPS_Simulator

This program was designed as a project for computer organization and design lesson 
which is part of the computer science curriculum.
this project simulates CPU and is not just a MIPS simulator but here it has been adjusted 
to run MIPS commands.
what makes this project unique is that it simulates a pipeline CPU precisely. 
so in every stage of the program you will be able to see what is really going on in the CPU.
also it implements hazard detection unit and forwarding unit which makes it immune to data and 
control hazards.
this project was designed by a two-person team . the logic part is designed by me and the input/output/graphics
was designed by my friend.
